| <h2>Rose Ruby</h3>A floral cut designed for corundum. Optimal for pink/lighter colored rubies and sapphires. The cut is quite precise and may be difficult to make due to the sharp facets. | ![Rose Ruby](https://github.com/MisterSirCode/Gem-Designs/blob/main/Rose%20Ruby/Rose%20Ruby.png) | ![Rose Ruby](https://github.com/MisterSirCode/Gem-Designs/blob/main/Rose%20Ruby/Rose%20Ruby.gif) |
| <h2>Starburst Rutile</h3>A pentagonal cut designed for rutile. Expresses layers of stars in the facets and refractive patterns. Works best with lighter / white rutiles, would not be as pretty with dark ones. | ![Starburst Rutile](https://github.com/MisterSirCode/Gem-Designs/blob/main/Starburst%20Rutile/Starburst%20Rutile.png) | ![Starburst Rutile](https://github.com/MisterSirCode/Gem-Designs/blob/main/Starburst%20Rutile/Starburst%20Rutile.gif) |
